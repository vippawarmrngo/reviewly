# Reviewly

AI pull request reviewer delivered as a GitHub App. Every number in this README was measured (see the limits next to each one).

```
GitHub --webhook--> API (verify HMAC, dedupe, insert job, enqueue) --> Postgres (source of truth: jobs, findings, usage)
                                   |                                        ^
                                   v                                        | reconciler re-enqueues lost jobs
                               Redis queue (fair per installation, retries, DLQ, visibility timeout)
                                   |
                                   v
                    Worker: diff -> filter -> redact -> LLM (fallback + circuit breaker) -> verify lines -> rank
                                   |                          ^ optional repo context (pgvector + full-text)
                                   v
                     one batched GitHub review  -->  dashboard, feedback (dismiss/accept), billing
```
Operations: [docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md). Load and failure tests: [docs/load-test.md](docs/load-test.md).

## Local dev
```
uv sync
make test      # pytest
make lint      # ruff + mypy
make up        # docker compose: postgres+pgvector, redis, migrate, api, worker
```

## Status
- [x] M1 skeleton: webhook verify, dedupe, idempotent enqueue, migrations, CI config
- [x] M2 worker + queue semantics: fair scheduler, per-installation cap, small-PR priority, retry/backoff+jitter, DLQ, visibility timeout, graceful shutdown, Postgres reconciler
- [x] M3 diff parsing, LLM review, structured output, line verification (verified with fakes and fixtures; not yet run against live Gemini/GitHub)
- [x] M4 repo index (tree-sitter chunks, pgvector + full-text), hybrid retrieval with RRF, LLM reranker, maintainer-feedback context. Off by default (`REVIEWLY_RAG_ENABLED`): its effect on review quality is not measured yet, that is M6
- [x] M5 secret redaction, injection hardening, per-installation token budget and rate limit, review cache, partial-review handling
- [x] M6 evaluation harness: 58 labeled cases, metrics with confidence intervals, record/replay, CI gate. Gemini numbers pending (needs an API key)
- [x] M7 dashboard (React + TypeScript, black on white with dark mode), feedback loop, usage metering, free tier, Stripe test-mode checkout
- [x] M8 observability (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry), load and failure tests with measured results, Fly.io config and runbook (not yet deployed)

## Performance (measured on one laptop, stub LLM; details and limits in [docs/load-test.md](docs/load-test.md))
- Webhook endpoint: p99 64 ms at 10 concurrent senders on one process; about 440 requests/s per process; 4 processes about 990/s (p99 83 ms at 25 senders).
- 500 PRs drained with no lost jobs and no duplicate reviews at 4, 8, 16 and 32 worker slots: 226, 446, 881 and 1576 reviews/min with a 1 s model (real models are slower).
- Survived, with every PR reviewed exactly once: primary model down, all models down for 45 s, Redis restart, Redis wiped, worker `kill -9`.
- Real-model quality numbers are in the Evaluation section. Nothing was run against real GitHub or on Fly.io.

## Using Reviewly
**As a user (no setup):** install the GitHub App on your repositories, then open a pull request. Reviewly reads the diff and posts one
review with inline comments and suggested fixes, usually within a minute. Sign in to the dashboard to see reviews, findings and
precision. Reply `@reviewly dismiss` or `@reviewly accept` to a comment (or react 👍/👎) and it learns what your team wants.

**Use your own AI model.** In the dashboard, open *AI model*, pick a provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, Mistral, or any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as OpenRouter), type the model name, paste your API key and press *Save and test key*. The key is checked
with a real call before it is saved, encrypted at rest (Fernet), never shown again (only its last four characters), and used only to review
your repositories. With your own key: your code goes to the provider you chose and never to Reviewly's, there is no fallback to Reviewly's
models if your key fails (the PR gets a notice instead), and reviews don't count against the free plan. Custom endpoints must be public
`https` URLs (private and internal addresses are refused). Repo-context search is skipped for these installations.

**Hosting it yourself**
1. `make up` (local) or deploy the same images with Postgres (pgvector) and Redis.
2. Set `REVIEWLY_ENV=prod`, `REVIEWLY_PUBLIC_URL`, `REVIEWLY_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `REVIEWLY_DASHBOARD_SECRET` (32+ random chars),
   `REVIEWLY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (`python -m app.core.crypto`) and `REVIEWLY_SETUP_TOKEN` (any random string). The app refuses to start otherwise.
3. Open `https://your-host/setup?token=<REVIEWLY_SETUP_TOKEN>` and press the button. GitHub creates the App with every setting pre-filled and
   this page shows its credentials once as environment variables. Put them in your host's secrets, remove `REVIEWLY_SETUP_TOKEN`, restart.
4. Add at least one platform model key (for example `REVIEWLY_GROQ_API_KEY`), or leave the platform without one so every installation must
   bring its own. Then install the App on a repo and open a PR.

**Try the whole system locally without GitHub:** `scripts/mock_github.py` is a fake GitHub API and `scripts/e2e_local.py` sends a PR through
webhook, queue, worker and your real LLM key (`docker-compose.e2e.yml`). One run of a real bug case produced a review with the correct inline
comment and fix suggestion in about 3 seconds.

## Repo context (M4) design notes
- Indexed per push to the default branch; incremental by git blob SHA, so unchanged files are never re-fetched or re-embedded.
- Chunks follow function/class boundaries (Python, JS/TS/TSX, Go, Java via tree-sitter; line windows for other text files).
- Retrieval = pgvector cosine + Postgres full-text, fused with reciprocal-rank fusion, then an optional LLM rerank. Chunks from files the PR changes are never used (the index holds the default branch, so they would be stale).
- Vector search is an exact scan scoped to one (installation, repo). An ANN index would apply its tenant filter after picking candidates and can return nothing for small tenants.
- Indexed code not seen by an index run for `REVIEWLY_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) is deleted; uninstalling or removing a repo purges it immediately.
- Without `REVIEWLY_GEMINI_API_KEY` the embedder falls back to a local hashing embedder: keyword overlap only, no semantic understanding.

## Cost and safety (M5) design notes
- **Redaction** runs on the parsed diff (added, removed and context lines) and on the PR title before anything is built from them, so prompts, retrieval queries and cache keys never contain a raw secret. A second, independent pass in the LLM guard and the embedder wrapper redacts again, so one bypassed layer does not leak. Indexed code is redacted before it is stored. It is line-preserving, so diff line numbers stay exact. It is pattern and entropy based: it catches common token formats, private keys, `password = "..."` assignments, URL credentials, JWTs and high-entropy strings, and it will miss secrets in unusual formats. Treat it as risk reduction, not a guarantee.
- **Prompt injection**: diff, title, retrieved context and feedback are delimited as untrusted data and forged delimiters are neutralized. Invisible/bidi/Unicode-tag characters are stripped. Added lines that address the AI reviewer produce a low-severity finding so humans see the attempt. The model's reply is also untrusted: it is stripped of images, remote links, HTML comments (so it cannot forge our idempotency markers), and @mentions are code-formatted so nobody is pinged. The bot only ever posts `COMMENT` reviews.
- **Budget**: a daily UTC token budget per installation, enforced atomically in Redis (reserve an estimate, settle to real usage). When it runs out mid-review the review is partial and says so; when nothing could be reviewed the PR gets a short notice and the job is skipped, not retried. `REVIEWLY_DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET=0` disables the limit. The default (500k) is a placeholder, not a measured figure.
- **Rate limit**: a token bucket per installation on LLM calls. Short waits are absorbed; a long wait fails the job into normal retry/backoff.
- **Cache**: keyed on the whitespace-normalized diff section plus prompt version, system prompt, repo rules, retrieved context and feedback, scoped per installation and expiring after `REVIEWLY_CACHE_TTL_DAYS`. It is deliberately *not* embedding-similarity based: `x > 0` and `x >= 0` embed almost identically, and replaying a stale review over a changed condition is the one mistake a reviewer cannot make. Reformatted code still hits; any real token change misses.

## Evaluation (M6)
`python -m eval.run --model gemini-2.5-flash --prompt v1` runs the real review pipeline (parsing, redaction, LLM, line
verification, ranking) against a fake GitHub on 58 labeled diffs and scores what it would have posted. See
[eval/dataset/README.md](eval/dataset/README.md) for how the labels were made and their limits, and
[eval/dataset/SOURCES.md](eval/dataset/SOURCES.md) for attribution.

- **Metrics:** precision, recall (per case), false alarms per PR that has nothing to find, raw line accuracy (share of the
  model's own findings that point at a line in the diff, measured *before* verification, so it shows hallucinated lines),
  latency p50/p95, tokens and cost per PR, with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals over cases.
- **Reproducible offline:** every LLM reply is recorded in `eval/recordings/`. `--mode replay` re-scores from them with no
  key and no network. Costs use the per-model price table in `app/llm/pricing.py`, which is not yet verified against
  provider pricing, so treat cost columns as estimates.
- **Baselines** prove the metrics behave: `baseline:null` (never comments) must score 0% recall, and `baseline:regex` is a
  naive anti-pattern matcher that any real model should beat.
- **Prompts are versioned** in `app/prompts/vN/`. A prompt change is only kept if `make eval` shows it helps.
- **CI** runs `python -m eval.validate` (dataset integrity) and `python -m eval.gate` (fails if a scored pipeline gets worse than
  its committed baseline in `eval/baseline.json`).

Reproduce: `make eval-baselines` (no key needed) or `make eval MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash PROMPT=v1` (needs
`REVIEWLY_GEMINI_API_KEY`), then `make eval-report` to refresh this table.

### What the numbers say
Measured on Groq's free tier (58 cases each; `gpt-oss-120b` and `qwen3.8-27b` had 0 errors, `gpt-oss-20b` had 6 cases that still
failed after retries and its row covers only the cases that scored).

- **Prompt v3 is a proven improvement on `gpt-oss-120b`.** Paired over the same 58 cases: precision +16.8 points (95% CI +6.1 to
  +28.0), false alarms per no-bug PR 1.18 to 0.53 (CI -1.24 to -0.17), recall unchanged (98%). v3 adds rules of evidence (no
  speculation about unseen code, no guessing intent, at most 3 findings, stricter confidence levels). Cost: about 33% more tokens per PR.
- **On `qwen3.8-27b` v3 helps in the same direction but not significantly** (precision +7.1 points, CI -0.3 to +14.3). Its v1 was already
  quieter than `gpt-oss-120b` v1.
- The default prompt is v3, and the default provider order is `gpt-oss-120b` with `qwen3.8-27b` as fallback.

### Read these numbers carefully
- 58 cases is small; the intervals are wide and many differences between models are not significant.
- **Recall is probably optimistic.** Labels mark whole regions a fix touched, a hit may be 2 lines away, and the bug cases come from
  famous libraries a model may have seen in training. Do not read 98% as "catches 98% of real bugs".
- **Precision is probably slightly pessimistic.** "Clean" PRs are only assumed clean, so a genuine latent bug reported there counts as a false alarm.
- Latency includes waiting out Groq's per-minute rate limits while several runs shared the budget, so treat it as an upper bound.
- Cost columns are n/a: no verified price for these models.
- Remaining false alarms are mostly confident speculation (0.93 to 0.95). The next improvement to try is a second verification pass that re-checks each finding against the visible diff.

## Dashboard, feedback and billing (M7)
**Run it locally with demo data**
```
make up                     # postgres, redis, migrations, api (serves the dashboard), worker
open "http://localhost:8000/auth/dev-login?installation=42"   # an empty dashboard: no fake data is seeded
```
`dev-login` exists only when `REVIEWLY_ENV=dev` and `REVIEWLY_DASHBOARD_DEV_LOGIN=true`; the app refuses to start outside dev
with placeholder secrets or with dev login on. Frontend work: `make dashboard-dev` (Vite, proxies to :8000) and `make dashboard-test`.

**The public site** (served by the same app, with real URLs): `/` a landing page, `/docs`, `/changelog`, `/status`, `/privacy` (data handling),
`/signin`, and the signed-in app at `/app` and `/app/settings`. Old `/#/…` links are redirected. Each page gets its own title, description,
canonical URL and social-preview tags from the server (using `REVIEWLY_PUBLIC_URL`, so **set it in production**), a sitemap, `robots.txt`, and a
404 page that returns a real 404. What it contains:
- **Landing:** an animated example review (clearly labeled "Example"; it plays only while on screen and shows its finished state under "reduce motion"),
  a strip of measured results with their caveats and sources, how it works, features, security, pricing that reads the server's real free allowance
  and whether billing is enabled, an accordion FAQ, a mobile menu, scroll-following section links and a scroll-progress bar.
- **Docs:** quick start, how a review works, accept/dismiss words and reactions, `.reviewly.yml` reference, bring-your-own-key, and why a PR gets no review.
  These facts come from `dashboard/src/content/*.json` and `reviewly.example.yml`, which backend tests compare with the real code (reply words, reactions,
  strictness thresholds, config limits, skip reasons, providers), so the docs cannot silently drift.
- **Changelog:** written from the commit history. **Status:** live `/readyz` (database, queue) with no invented uptime or history.
- It makes no claims it cannot back (no customer logos, uptime numbers or compliance badges) and adds no analytics or trackers.
- **Motion** uses framer-motion (loaded lazily) and every animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. **Brand assets** (`favicon.svg`, touch icon, social image)
  are rendered by `dashboard/scripts/render_brand.mjs`.

**Measured on this build** (headless Chromium against the local server, simulated throttling, so treat as indicative): Lighthouse on `/` scored
performance 97–98 on mobile (largest paint about 2.2 s) and 100 on desktop, with accessibility, best practices and SEO at 100; the docs page scored 97–100 on
performance and 100 on the rest. An automated audit (`dashboard/scripts/audit.mjs`: axe accessibility rules, console errors, horizontal overflow) over
every page at 390, 768 and 1280 px in light and dark mode found no violations after the fixes it prompted. JavaScript needed for a first visit is about 90 KB
gzip (CI fails above 120 KB: `npm run size`). Not part of CI: the browser audits need a running server and a browser. Not done: a prerendered snapshot
(the site is client-rendered, so non-JavaScript crawlers only see the meta tags), translations.

**The dashboard** has two views, grey and white (dark mode follows the system until you press the toggle). *Overview*: summary tiles,
precision by rule, reviews per month (with a table view), repositories, and recent reviews (each linking to its PR; the page refreshes
itself every 20 s while a review is running). *Settings*: plan and usage, and the AI model / your own key. It has loading skeletons,
retry on errors, an error boundary, a skip link and keyboard focus handling. Installations are named after the account they were used on.
Every query is scoped to one installation, and another tenant's installation returns 404.

**Web hardening.** Strict Content-Security-Policy (own scripts only, no framing), `nosniff`, referrer and permissions policies, HSTS
in production, `Origin` checking on state-changing dashboard requests (on top of `SameSite=Lax` cookies), `no-store` on API answers,
year-long immutable caching for hashed assets, gzip. Checked in a real headless Chromium at desktop and phone widths in light and
dark mode (no console errors, no horizontal overflow); this is a manual check, not part of CI.

**Feedback loop.** Reviewly learns what maintainers think of its comments from:
- a reply `@reviewly dismiss` or `@reviewly accept` (a deliberate command always outranks reactions),
- reactions on its comment (👍 ❤️ 🎉 🚀 accept; 👎 😕 dismiss; bots ignored), polled every 10 minutes because GitHub sends no webhook for reactions,
- resolving a thread, which is shown but **not** counted in precision (people resolve threads for many reasons).

Precision per rule (category) is `accepted / (accepted + dismissed)` and is shown as a dash, never 0% or 100%, until something is judged.
A finding a repo's maintainers have dismissed at least twice and never accepted is suppressed there from then on.

**Free tier and billing.** Each installation gets `REVIEWLY_FREE_REVIEWS_PER_MONTH` reviews per UTC month (default 20, a placeholder;
0 = unlimited). Over the limit, the PR gets a short notice and no tokens are spent. Stripe test-mode Checkout upgrades an installation;
signed webhooks (`/webhooks/stripe`, timestamp-checked against replay) keep the subscription in sync, with a 3-day grace for failed payments.

**Not verified against the real services** (no credentials were available): GitHub OAuth login, the reaction polling and
comment linking against GitHub itself, and Stripe Checkout and its webhooks. All are covered by tests with mocked HTTP; the
feedback webhook, dashboard API, tenant isolation and a comment id above 2^31 were exercised live against Postgres.
Cost figures show "n/a" because there is no verified price for the models in use.

## Bring your own key: safety notes
- **Encryption:** keys are stored with Fernet (`REVIEWLY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, comma-separated to rotate: the first key encrypts, all decrypt).
  Losing the key makes stored keys unreadable; affected installations are told to re-enter theirs instead of silently using Reviewly's models.
- **SSRF:** a custom endpoint must be `https`, on a public hostname whose every DNS answer is a public address, checked when saved and again
  before each use. The connection itself then resolves the name once, re-checks every answer and connects to that exact address (`app/core/pinned_http.py`),
  so DNS rebinding cannot swap in an internal address; environment proxies and redirects are disabled for these calls. In dev mode
  (`REVIEWLY_ENV=dev`) this client is off so local endpoints work. The check is tested with a scripted resolver, not against a live rebinding server.
- **Abuse:** each save/test makes a real call to a user-chosen endpoint, so it is limited to 10 per installation per hour.
- **Not verified:** the Anthropic, OpenAI and custom-endpoint adapters have only been exercised against mocked HTTP. Groq was exercised live
  (a wrong key was refused; the real key saved; the next review used the chosen model).
